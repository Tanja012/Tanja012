Texturepack - A Realistic texturepack for minecraft 64x64... in future will also add a 32x32 version...

And way in the future I plan on making a Hand-Drawn-on-PC Texturepack(more cartoonish)


Theme's - For now it's just a google chrome theme, but in the future there will be themes for various part's of Windows... 


Drawing's - I've been drawing since I was 2 years old. Here you can all of my best drawing's in the categories: My own strange creatures, LIVE drawing's, Drawn photography's,  Hand "copies" Of Other's Drawing's... There is also a few cloth design's.


Various Acrylic Painting's - Always loved to paint, but didn't make very nice ones before going to 10th grade. see the best ones... :)


Photo's - Always liked photo's but went crazy for photographing the nature, at the age around 18, I think. Could walk around for hours just photographing in a park, if the battery didn't fail before that:P


Clothes - Since trying to use a sewing machine in school many years ago. I've felt that it's the best feeling ever! Even had a plan to be a designer, but that plan changed;)
